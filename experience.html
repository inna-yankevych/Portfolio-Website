                    <h3>Supervisor/Front of House Server</h3>
                    <p><strong>Short Round Cafe</strong>, 2018-2024</p>
                    <p>Working at the cafe really helped me develop my customer service skills, especially in a fast-paced, ever-changing environment. I worked closely with the team to make sure communication stayed clear and things ran efficiently. Throughout my time there, I learned to stay calm under pressure and think on my feet, whether it was handling last-minute orders or helping customers in a busy rush. I enjoyed taking on responsibility and being a key part of the team to make sure things kept running smoothly, while also making sure customers had a great experience.</p>

                    <h3>Victorian State Government Compliance Administrator</h3>
                    <p><strong>Hays Recruitment</strong>, May 2022 - September 2022</p>
                    <p>My time working as a Compliance Administrator allowed me to build many new skills. Some of my responsibilities included managing compliance reports, accurate input and maintenance of customer information in compliance with customer service delivery standards, attending team meetings as required, assisting with Reception cover and other ad-hoc duties. My well-established customer-service skills allowed me to conduct Reference checks on behalf of consultants for candidates working through Hays and I was able to correspond with candidate enquiries as requested by consulting staff. I worked with multiple teams to tackle problems, putting my strong communication skills to good use.</p>

                    <p>This portfolio is the very first website I’ve ever built, and it was such a rewarding experience. It was definitely challenging, but in the best way. I really enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of it - every step pushed me to apply and improve the HTML and CSS skills I’ve been learning over the last month. It was great to see how all the pieces came together, and I’m pleased with how much this project taught me throughout the process.</p>
