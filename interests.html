                <p class="interest-para">I’ve only been seriously pursuing this interest recently, as I started my Diploma at Coder Academy. But even in that short time it’s been such an amazing journey. As someone who’s both a creative thinker and a problem-solver, coding is the perfect blend - it pushes me to think critically and allows me to explore my creativity.</p>

                <p class="interest-para">I’m really passionate about movement — I love Pilates, Yoga, and weightlifting — but hiking stands out because it combines physical activity with time in nature. There’s something incredibly peaceful about escaping the city for a day, whether with friends or solo. It helps me clear my mind and reconnect with the world in a more grounded way.</p>

                <p class="interest-para">I always had a piano growing up, so by the time I was seven, I convinced my parents to enrol me in some lessons. Since moving out of home I went through long stretches without playing, since I didn’t have a piano of my own. But recently, I finally bought a digital piano - and it’s becoming such a meditative way to unwind and reconnect with something I’ve always loved.</p>

                <p class="interest-para">When I have a bit of downtime - maybe a long weekend or time off - I love settling in with a big jigsaw puzzle. There’s something so rewarding about the process of figuring out where each piece fits. I think it taps into that same part of my brain that enjoys coding: focused and problem-solving. It’s a quiet and screen-free way to relax while also keeping my mind engaged.</p>
